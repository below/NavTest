The question really is:

How can I position a custom UINavigationBar so that it fits like the standard one?

See the attached example: My own UINavigationBar will sit at the top of the screen, not under the status bar.

I have tried to change the "Extend Edges" Setting, to not much success.

Any hints are appreciated
